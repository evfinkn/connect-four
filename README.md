# connect-four
Connect Four made using Pygame
 
## Installation
Download ConnectFour.py and move to any directory. The game will make a text file to save the game, so you may want to put the py file into its own directory.
Make sure you have the Pygame module installed. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
 
## Usage
Open up terminal / command prompt and cd to the directory where you moved ConnectFour.py. Then, run it using python.
